### CrystalsCollector Game 

1. Here's how the app works:

   * There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The player will be shown a random number "Match this number" at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's current score. 

   * The player wins if their current score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

* When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
